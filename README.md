# SAS Fat to Slim 



## üìù Problem Statement

During the 24-hour long hackathon "Hack the Tank 2.0", we tackled the challenge of streamlining client data management and communication for "SAS Fit to Slim". The goal was to create an efficient web application consisting of a client-facing site and an admin portal to enhance user interaction and administrative monitoring.

## üí° Our Solution

We developed two interconnected web platforms:

### Client Portal:
- **Interactive UI:** Home, Services, About Us, and Contact pages.
- **Customer Support:** Integrated chatbot and WhatsApp bot for easy appointment scheduling and queries.
- **Extra Features:** A BMI calculator to engage and provide value to the clients.

### Admin Portal:
- **Role-Based Access:** Secure login system with differentiated admin and user roles.
- **User Activity Tracking:** Visual analytics for monitoring page visits and user engagement.
- **Communication Hub:** Capability to send messages directly to users, with preset prompts and real-time data access.
- **Data Management:** Tools for both individual and aggregated client data handling.



## üìä Tech Stack

Our application is built with the following technologies:

- **Frontend:**
  - [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/): For crafting a dynamic and responsive user interface.
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Utilized for styling and designing a sleek UI.

- **Backend:**
  - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/): The JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
  - [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/): The web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.

- **Database:**
  - [MongoDB Cloud](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud): For a fully-managed cloud database with scalability and security.

- **Others:**
  - .gitignore: To keep our repository clean by excluding files that are not part of the source code.

## üìä Behind the Scenes

For the admin, we provided powerful back-end functionality that includes:

- Graphical presentations of user metrics.
- Session tracking for enhanced user experience understanding.
- Predictive analytics to help anticipate client needs based on historical data.

## ü§ñ Chatbot Integration

Both client and admin sides are equipped with intelligent chatbots designed to:

- Streamline the appointment setting process.
- Provide immediate responses to common queries.
- Offer a personal touch to the digital experience.
